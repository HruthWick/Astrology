A simple AI Astrologer application that takes user birth details (Name, Date, Time, Place) and provides astrology-based responses.
AI Astrologer 
A web-based astrology application developed using **Streamlit** and driven by **Groq LLMs**.
The application asks for your **Name, Date, Time, and Place of Birth**, after which it produces:

- A **customized reading** based on your Sun sign, element, life path number, and a fun "rising vibe".
- A **Q&A section** where you can submit a free-text question (career, love, health, money, education, travel, etc.) and get an AI-written response.

> ⚠️ For entertainment purposes only. This app is not a substitute for professional advice.
